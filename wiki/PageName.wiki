We plan on releasing the source code to a simple softphone utilizing this wrapper very soon. Until then here's a quick start guide:

   1.
      //Create a new instance of the IAXClient
   2.
      IAXClient iax = new IAXClient();
   3.
       
   4.
      //initialize 4 lines
   5.
      iax.initialize(4);
   6.
      //register with the Asterisk (or whatever) server
   7.
      iax.register("user1", "pass1", "192.168.1.1");
   8.
      //Create an event handler to handle the Call State Events.
   9.
      iax.IAXCallStateEvent += new IAXClient.IAXCallStateEventHandler(HandleIAXCallStateEvent);
  10.
       
  11.
      //Place a call with the wrapper
  12.
      int callno = iax.placeCall("user1:pass1@192.168.1.1/18005551212");
